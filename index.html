<div style="text-align:center; font-size:16pt; margin:50px,"><p>Hello, and welcome to my personal page!  I am happy to have you here!<br/>
I am still working on this page.  I liked how Richard Stallman (I need to be clear in denouncing some of his ideas though as he is very problematic IMO) designed his personal page, so you might notice some imitation in design<br>
This site will be dedicated to my personal life, views, and hobbies.  Think of this like how the web used to be</p></div>

<div style="text-align:center; font-size 18pt; margin:50px,"><p>I am a Trans Woman living in Northern Idaho with my family.<br/>
Northern Idaho is one of the most beautiful places on this planet, and it is a shame that it is filled with sexists, racists, homophobes, transphobes, nazis, and many other horrible people.<br/>
As much as I love this area, I plan on moving to the PNW proper, specifically along the coast.  I am presently in need of a vehicle to live in during this intermitent timeframe, but I will settle<br/>
in Seattle, Portland, Eugene, or somewhere along the Washington/Oregon coast.<br/>
I am actively looking for a T4T polycule, preferably in Portland or Seattle.  These are the two most beautiful cities I have even been to, and I look forward to one day calling either one home.</p></div>

<div style="text-align:center; font-size:14pt; margin:50px,"><p>I'm just a silly girl who loves Books, Clothes, Coins, Comics, Computing, and the Outdoors!  I run a preservation project which aims to save every Archie Comic.  The project is (as of November 2025) on hold until sometime next year when I can dedicate more time to it.  I estimate I have roughly 42% of all Floppies, Digests, and Trade Paperbacks<br/>
As a more recently out transgirl, my sense of fashion has been hindered by years of self-hatred and doing the bare minimum to stay alive.  Therefore, I am still finding out about what goes with what, colors, shades, designs, etc - let alone accessories!  My wardrobe is mix and match with plenty of things I have gotten from<br/>
thrift shops,and a few lower end clothing stores.  I live in a more conservative area, so many of the pieces I am able to find at the thrifts are unfortunately not as daring as I wish, but thankfully I like the more "traditional" dresses, so its not all bad.  Fashion is something I greatly enjoy (as well as my recently found love of makeup), and so I can't wait to share photos of myself in different outfits that I think look good on me!<br/>

<div style="text-align:center; font-size 20pt; margin:60px,"><p>This site was previously hosted on VULTR, but my lapse in payment (I'm a broke hoe) resulted in the website being offline for a few months.  I planned to self-host, but have instead went with a seperate provider.</p>
