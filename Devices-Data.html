<h2>My Storage</h2>

<p>I have a variety of storage mediums, from Hard Drives to MicroSD Cards, and everything inbetween.  I believe in keeping your media on your own personal "cloud" (local storage).  With this, you can use a remote connection by setting up a media streaming service (Kodi, Plex, Emby, FTP, DLNA, etc.)  I believe I presently have around 135-150TB of total RAW storage, with about 90% of that full of Movies, Shows, Porn, Games, Anime, Cartoons, Comics/e-books, etc.</p>
